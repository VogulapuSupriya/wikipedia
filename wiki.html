    <h1>Technology</h1>

    <p class="para1">
        <b>Technology</b> is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way.[1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2]: 117 [3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or
        machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.<br>

    <p class="para">Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development
        of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have
        lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p class="para2">
        <i>Technology</i> is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' (from Greek Τεχνολογία, from the Greek: τέχνη, romanized: tékhnē, lit.  'craft, art' and -λογία, 'study, knowledge').[4][5] It is predated in use
        by the Ancient Greek word tékhnē, used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.<br><br>[6] Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms Technik (German) or technique
        (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.[2]: 114–115  At the time, Technologie (German and French) referred either to
        the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."[2]: 117  Since the distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English,
        both were translated as technology.<br><br> The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[7] In the 20th century, as a result of scientific progress
        and the Second Industrial Revolution, technology stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on its current-day meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.[2]: 119 </p>
    <h2>History</h2>

    <i>Main articles:<a> History of technology and Timeline of historic inventions</a></i><br><br>
    <b>Prehistoric</b><br><br>
    <i>Main article: <a>Prehistoric Technology</a></i>
    <p>Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error.[8] Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp hand axe.[9] This practice was refined
        75 kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work.[10]</p>
    <b>Neolithic</b><br><br>
    <i>Main article:<a> Neolithic Revolution</a></i>
    <p>The Neolithic Revolution (or First Agricultural Revolution) brought about an acceleration of technological innovation, and a consequent increase in social complexity.[24] The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale
        forest clearance and farming.[25] This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland.[26] Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition
        to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer
        activities.
